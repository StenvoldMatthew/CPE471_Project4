To run the code, simply run 'python3 .\driver.py' while in the correct directory. The program will run over all the scenarios that the assignment asked for. It will print which scenario it is showing in the terminal, which follows this key:

scenarioId meanings:
  0 - Baseline: No noise
  1 - (c) GPS covariance noise on entire dataset
  2 - (c) GPS covariance noise on partial dataset
  3 - (d) IMU covariance noise on entire dataset
  4 - (d) IMU covariance noise on partial dataset
  5 - (e) GPS position noise with changed covariance (entire dataset)
  6 - (e) GPS position noise with changed covariance (partial dataset)
